    "# Vector Data I/O in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading data into Python is usually the first step of an analysis workflow. There are various different GIS data formats available such as [Shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile), [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON), [KML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language), and [GPKG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoPackage). [Geopandas](http://geopandas.org/io.html) is capable of reading data from all of these formats (plus many more). \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show some typical examples how to read (and write) data from different sources. The main point in this section is to demonstrate the basic syntax for reading and writing data using short code snippets. You can find the example data sets in the data-folder. However, most of the example databases do not exists, but you can use and modify the example syntax according to your own setup."

    "## File formats\n",
    "\n",
    "In geopandas, we use a generic function [from_file()](http://geopandas.org/reference.html#geopandas.GeoDataFrame.to_file) for reading in different data formats. In the bacground, Geopandas uses [fiona.open()](https://fiona.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fiona.html#fiona.open) when reading in data. Esri Shapefile is the default file format. For other file formats we need to specify which driver to use for reading in the data. \n",
