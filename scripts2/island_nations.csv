But the visible surface of the Earth is comparatively young and continuously in motion, so that current topography is only ever a snapshot. Unsurprisingly, some islands are relatively old in Earth terms, whilst the birth of others, mostly in volcanic island regions such as Iceland or Tonga, can be witnessed live and in colour.  La Désirade is a silent witness of the formation of an entire tectonic plate. The Caribbean Plate initially formed about 150 million years ago through hotspot volcanism on the Pacific sea floor and subsequently moved east over thousands of kilometres – into the Atlantic Ocean which was only just emerging then. The plate reached its current position about 100 million years ago where it represents the foundation of an entire island region. Bizarre tuff and basalt formations along the rugged coast of the island are indicative of this history. Special forms of pillow lava point to the island’s underwater origins at a depth of 3,000 to 4,000 m; marine microfossils are evidence of its long plate-tectonic journey.  Humans first settled on La Désirade around 5,000 years ago. In the middle of the last millennium, the island, which is only 22 km² in size, was the desired anchoring point for European conquerors after their long and uncertain journey across the Atlantic. The indigenous population fought valiantly to prevent a European takeover, but the military forces of the colonisers were vastly superior. The last indigenous residents were eventually deported to a neighbouring island, and a plantation-based economy was introduced, typical at the time for the entire region. Although the first European visitor sailed under the Spanish flag, today’s 1,500 residents mostly speak French and earn their living from agriculture, fishing and a little tourism. Above all, though, the island has remained a Mecca for geologists from all over the world."

Apart from other impacts, the IPCC and other institutions are forecasting sea level rise that could massively threaten populations in coastal areas. Small islands are particularly vulnerable on account of their geographical specificities, such as their small size, long coastlines, particularly sensitive ecosystems, and issues surrounding food security and freshwater supply. Moreover, small island societies usually lack the necessary financial means to effectively protect themselves from the impacts of sea level rise and extreme weather events. So far, the public discourse surrounding the impacts of climate change on small islands has almost exclusively focused on warm coral islands and atolls in the tropics, such as Tuvalu or the Maldives.  Sarichef Island highlights the fact that cold islands can be just as badly affected by climate change as their warmer cousins. The ssland is only seven kilometres in length and part of a 100 km-long system of barrier islands. It is situated on the Bering Strait which for a long time separated two rivalling superpowers; the International Date Line still runs through it. The island was given its current name by the Baltic-German explorer Otto von Kotzebue; he named it after his Vice Admiral in 1816 and claimed it for the Russian Tsar. At that time, the island had already been inhabited for about 200 years by the Iñupiat who had a settlement there and almost exclusively subsisted on whaling, fishing and sealing. Already then, the flat island was potentially highly vulnerable to storm surges and extreme weather events. But the sea ice, present nearly all year round, acted as a powerful protective shield against the surging waves. Additionally, the houses of the indigenous population were erected on permafrost soil which is not susceptible to erosion.  Today, this natural defence has all but disappeared. In northern climes global warming is making itself felt at double the global average. As a consequence, more and more sea ice is melting, affording less and less protection to the island from storm surges. Moreover, the permafrost is thawing, rendering the coastline highly susceptible to erosion which is in turn exacerbated by rising sea levels. Despite artificial coastal defences the island is therefore losing 3.3 metres of land a year, and many houses and roads have already been washed away.  There is mounting evidence that the island will become uninhabitable in only a few decades’ time. For this reason, the majority of the 600 inhabitants voted to move their village to the nearby mainland in a 2016 referendum. At this stage, however, it is entirely unclear how this will be financed: The responsible authorities have made available a meagre $8 million out of the $200 million needed, so it is unlikely that the resettlement will take place any time soon. The heated debate surrounding the future of the small island society shows that the devastating effects of climate change have firmly arrived in the northern hemisphere."

Ternate impressively demonstrates how the interaction of historical, political and geographical forces can turn islands into central nodes of power, pawns in the game or else peripheries of global events. Centuries before the term ‘globalisation’ first found mention in scientific publications, international connections developed within various realms of human existence. The so-called transatlantic trade triangle not only enabled the exchange of resources between three global regions (mostly precious metals, sugar, arms and slaves), but also led to fundamental shifts within societies, political power structures and ecologies. In the Caribbean, multi-cultural population structures developed as a result of indigenous, European and African influence; in Europe, new crops began to arrive that nobody had ever heard of before. In a nutshell, globalisation began long before it became known as such. Islands have always played an important role in this global exchange as “outposts of globalisation”. Ternate can confidently be termed a hub of the early global economy. For a long time it even held a worldwide monopoly on certain agricultural products. European and Chinese economic interests met here, and the island also witnessed a form of cultural expansion when a Muslim Sultanate became established as early as the 13th century, about 10,000 km away from Mecca. Although the volcanic island steeply rises from the sea, its area of merely 112 km² makes it tiny compared to its neighbours. It takes a leisurely 45 minutes to do a full circle on the coastal ring road. Nevertheless, for a long period the island was a centre of economic, political and cultural power. It played a central part in establishing the Muslim faith in the eastern part of what is now the world’s largest Muslim country. Clever diplomacy also enabled the island to stand up to foreign political interests whilst benefitting from a considerable share in the global spice trade.  For nearby China, Ternate was an outpost of the world of spices and of the Chinese trading empire. The Portuguese Francisco Serrão was the first European to arrive here in 1513. Eight years later the legendary explorer Ferdinand Magellan briefly stopped over on the island during his circumnavigation. Although the ruling Sultan allowed the construction of a Portuguese fort as a regional trading base and military stronghold, he did not cede any territorial authority to the Europeans. The two leading maritime powers of the time, Spain and Portugal, competed for the trading monopoly with the countries just discovered far from home. Local power elites made clever use of this conflict of interest. From 1529 onwards neither party was tolerated any longer by the Sultanates, giving room to the rise of another significant actor in the early global economy: The Dutch East India Company. The Dutch, however, went home every year, returning with fresh troops only the following year. The Spanish made use of their absence by repeatedly spreading out on the island. According to legend, a local Chinese merchant defused tensions between the European powers by cleverly dividing the island, giving the North to the red-heads and the South to the white-necks. In the early 17th century the Dutch ousted the Sultan’s family from power and began the large-scale cultivation of cloves with the intention of creating a monopoly. At that time, the islands had already become known in Europe as the “Spice Islands”. The name of Ternate would have been known to overseas traders around the world. Today only few people have even heard of the archipelago. With its economic decline in the 19th century the island too lost its significance. During the Second World War it was occupied by Japan; after decolonisation it became part of the largest island state of the world, sealing its fate as a peripheral outpost of the world. Volcanologists still appreciate the island as its central volcano, rising a proud 1,715 metres above sea level, is one of the most active in the region. With a total of 176,000 inhabitants (2010) the island is also relatively densely populated."

Approaching the Tiran and Sanafir in a boat without any prior knowledge, it is hard to imagine that the two bare and dusty elevations whose arid surfaces resemble an inhospitable moon landscape could hold any political significance at all. A brief look through the history books, however, quickly reveals the enormous geostrategic relevance of the two neighbouring islands. In 1956 the two islands were occupied by the troops of Israel – a state that had only existed for eight years by then. The purpose was to secure the supply of oil for its European allies. Relations between the states involved in this conflict (Suez War) remained tense and escalated eleven years later into the Six-Day War. Once again, the casus belli for the military conflict was the occupation of the two islands – this time by the troops of Egypt, cutting off its regional arch enemy’s access to the Indian Ocean. The world had become divided into blocks by then, and both blocks held their breath. The closure of the strait between the two islands was regarded as a clear breach of the 1958 UNCLOS convention which granted freedom of navigation to all nations of the world. In later decades all went quiet on the two islands. They are still not inhabited by civilians, but 1,900 soldiers and twelve multinational peace keepers and the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) are stationed there. In April 2016 the islands suddenly leapt back to international attention when Egypt made to give them to Saudi Arabia as a sort of diplomatic gift. The islands are likely to remain a talking point. Despite the continuing territorial uncertainties, there are plans to link the two islands with a bridge spanning 32 km, creating another land link between Africa and Asia. The associated road and rail links will also run across Tiran. It is questionable whether the regional powers will really warm to this gigantic construction project which will yet again shift the geopolitical architecture of the wider region. "

A solid foundation for one of the fastest growing and most densely settled urban spaces of its time was created by ramming thousands of wooden pillars into the boggy, uninhabitable ground. Up to this day this island space extends over an incredible 118 small islands that are linked to each other by numerous bridges. A bird’s eye view of the city centre of Venice gives the impression of a single large island bisected by an s-shaped canal. Due to its favourable location between two global empires, the island city quickly advanced to one of the world’s most significant trading centres. From the late 7th century onwards it was the heart of an independent republic that maintained an extensive colonial empire and numerous trade posts in many areas of the then known world. The legendary wealth of its inhabitants was not only due to trade and significant geopolitical influence, but also to ship building which resembled modern assembly line production long before the industrial age on account of a high degree of systematization. With the discovery of the New World global trade increasingly shifted westwards. Venice gradually lost its significance, and the republic abruptly dissolved in 1797 when it was occupied by an important warlord. In its heyday the island city developed a rich cultural life; this and its unique visual appear-ance attracted artists and intellectuals from all over the world. Venice repeatedly became the setting for world-renowned literature and it is still a favoured location for film shoots. Its global fame has turned the urban island conglomerate into one of the most visited cities ever, regularly overburdening the local infrastructure, leading to serious processes of social change and also causing environmental problems. Rising sea levels, however, pose a much greater challenge to the island city today. The sea is gnawing away at the city’s foundations, squares and streets are flooded ever more frequently, and many basements of the once magnificent houses have become uninhabitable already. Still, the city is resisting the forces of nature. A huge and very expensive flood protection system, consisting of enor-mous hydraulic tide gates, is to stop the town from drowning."

Europeans have known about the islands since the 17th century, but its inhabitants, variously feared as cannibals or glorified as “noble savages”, did not lose their political independence until 1874 to the British crown. After a short period the new colonial power established the same sugar cane economy that had become such a success story on other islands under Crown rule, helping to sweeten the tea that people back home in British towns and cities had grown so very fond of.  The warm humid climate of Viti Levu was perfectly suited for growing sugar cane, so large parts of the wooded island were cleared to create huge sugar cane plantations. There was just one small problem: The indigenous population, stripped of its political freedom, refused to work on the white settler’s plantations. As a result, between 1879 and 1916 the British brought around 61,000 Indian contract workers to the island to do the hard labour in the fields. Most of these economic migrants had come to stay, and so Hindu temples soon characterised many coastal settlements. From the mid-20th century onwards the descendants of the Indian workers represented the majority of the population, leading to increasing ethnic tensions with the indigenous population who saw the privileged position they had enjoyed under the British increasing threatened. When the archipelago gained its independence in 1970, a constitution was drawn up that structurally disadvantaged the Indian population, triggering an ongoing phase of political unrest. Between 1987 and 2006 alone four coups took place, and international media repeatedly reported on the scenario of a “failed state”. Exclusion from the British Commonwealth and low world market prices for sugar put huge pressure on the local economy, leading to a mass exodus of the politically suppressed but economically dominant Indian population. Today tourism has replaced sugar as the most important economic factor.  Suva on the southeast coast of Viti Levu is Fiji's political and administrative capital as well as the largest and most cosmopolitan city in the southern Pacific Ocean (total urban population 2007: 330,000)."
